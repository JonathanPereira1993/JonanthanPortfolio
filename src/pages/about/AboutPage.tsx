            formattedDescription="Jonathan â€“ Front-End Developer | Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

Iâ€™m Jonathan, a self-taught front-end developer passionate about crafting modern, user-friendly web experiences. Based in Portugal, I have over three years of experience in the tech industry, where I started working with OutSystems (a low-code platform) and closely collaborating with UX/UI teams.

Beyond low-code, I write JavaScript, style with CSS/SCSS, and continuously explore new technologies to refine my craft. Currently, Iâ€™m building personal projects with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, always pushing myself to grow as a developer.

My journey into tech began with a background in Web Development & Multimedia, followed by a bachelorâ€™s degree in Games & Multimedia. This academic foundation gave me a strong grasp of design, programming, and digital mediaâ€”skills that allow me to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality in web development.

Creativity is at the core of everything I do. Whether itâ€™s coding, designing, or playing the drumsâ€”one of my biggest hobbiesâ€”I love expressing myself through different forms of creation. Iâ€™m always eager to be part of projects that make a difference, collaborating with like-minded people to build meaningful and impactful experiences.

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m constantly seeking personal growth. I love reading great books that challenge my thinking, expand my knowledge, and help me become a better version of myself. For me, learning never stopsâ€”whether itâ€™s through code, music, or the wisdom found in a good book.

Driven by curiosity and a problem-solving mindset, I thrive on learning, adapting, and pushing boundaries to create seamless digital experiences."
