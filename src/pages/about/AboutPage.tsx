With over two years of experience in a tech company, I started my journey working with Outsystems (a low-code platform), collaborating with UX/UI teams. Beyond that, I write JavaScript, style with CSS/SCSS, and continuously expand my skills by exploring new technologies. Currently, Iâ€™m building personal projects with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, constantly challenging myself to grow as a developer.

Before diving into web development, I studied Web Development & Multimedia, followed by a Games & Multimedia bachelorâ€™s degree. This academic background introduced me to design, programming, and digital media, equipping me with the skills to navigate the corporate world and take on real-world projects."
